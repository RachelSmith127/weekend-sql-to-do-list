# To Do List

## Description

I wanted a way to be able to digitally document my daily tasks. I found myself spending too much time looking for a paper copy of my task list so I made an app! 

The App I created allows users to be able to document and update their task list. A new task can be added by clicking the 'submit new task button'. When a task is completed the user can mark the item as complete. If a list item has been marked complete it also highlighted green to indicate that it has been completed. If the user mistakenly marks a task as complete they can go back and mark the task as incomplete. If the task is no longer relevant it can be removed completely from the list by clicking the 'delete button'. 

## Installation 

1.Create a database named weekend-to-do-app,
2.The queries in the tables.sql file (this table is named tasks) are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3.Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
4.Run npm run server in your terminal
5.Run npm run client in your terminal
6.The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Built With
This app uses, Node, express, bootstrap, json, CSS, html, and pg.
